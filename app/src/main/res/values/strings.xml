    <string name="text_bio">In over half a century, Straus has lived as a child, a United States Marine, a scholar, a husband and father, a researcher and acoustician, a teacher and preacher, and a builder and grower. While pursuing the passions of the life being lived, which accumulated throughout the total life, the underlying passion of his existence has been an agape love for all living things and the prayer that every interaction with every human being may have left a lasting, positive memory somewhere in that persons memory storage device. </string>
